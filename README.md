# Node-Red Nodes for MegaIO™ Expansion Card
This project aims to provide direct support for the Sequent MicrosystemsMegaIO™
expansion card for the Raspberry Pi. It exists because of a personal need to
interface with the MegaIO board. I'll respond to issues and PRs whenever I have
time, but please do not be offended if I don't immediately take action.

## Support
Support for the MegaIO board is currently limited to the following items:
* n/a

Current WIP items are:
* Relays

## Installation
For now, it's probably easiest to add this Git repository directly to your
Node-Red project's dependency list. I'll be working on proper packaging in the
future.

## Usage
There is currently no functional code in place. Specific funcionity will be
added to this section as features are added.
